# BuilderTrend-Text-Extraction
This application will be used to extract text using Apache tika from various different files
and store it in an Elasticsearch client for later searching. 

# Release Notes:
Currently we have the classes we will need made, but they are not yet implemented.
We also currently have a testing class that is being used to ensure everyone has
their environment set up to use Apache Tika and ElasticSearch.
