# BuilderTrend-Text-Extraction
This application will be used to extract text using Apache tika from various different files
and store it in an Elasticsearch client for later searching. 

# Release Notes:
Currently the application has all of the base functionality working. It is able to extract text
from both text based files and images. There is also a simple user interface to showcase the 
functionality of the application. A simple test suite has been implemented in order to test out
the basic classes currently being used excluding the Elasticsearch client access.
